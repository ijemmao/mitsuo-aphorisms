# Aida Mitsuo Aphorisms
You can read the aphorisms and experience the visual at [aidamitsuo.surge.sh](http://aidamitsuo.surge.sh)

## Description 📝
An in-browser visual art experience to represent some of the most popular aphorisms created by world-renowned calligrapher Aida Mitsuo.

This pieces are purposely vague and abstract. I want the viewer to create their own creations or draw their own conclusions. The power of Mitsuo's aphorisms is that the reader is able to find a meaning in each piece that is true to them; I want my art to do the same.
